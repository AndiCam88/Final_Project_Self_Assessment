# Final_Project_Self_Assessment

## Self Assesment

what roles I played
During the completing of this project I set up and maintained the repository, and compiled the slideshow. I gathered visuals and communicated with each team member about their part of the presentation and did my best to understand what was being added to the repository. i did my best to keep up with adding to the presentation as it was being added to the repository.

contributed to
team discussion 
I made sure to be available for each team meeting and did my best to ask questions to better undertand what was expected of me and what ways I could help each team member. I helped brainstorm solutions, and avenues for the way our project could take.
peer reviews
I did my best to listen and understand. however, I found my team mates to be far more knowlegable in their respective roles. 

greatest personal challenge over the course of the project and how overcame
I am very new to coding and felt that I needed more knowlege to be able to contribute effectively. I look forward to continue to grow in this field and pool of knowlege so I can be more comfortable contributing.


## Team Assesment

teamwork?
Our team was really good at fullfilling our individual roles. We trusted each other to get what was expected of us done (according to the ruberic of the assignment). 

communication protocol
we communicated through slack and class time, we offered our numbers to each other in cases of emergencies, but did not utilize them.

challenges
Not everyone was able to make it to every meeting from personal reasons to techical issues. but if someone missed a meeting, we would regroup on slack briefly afterods. We had an issue of consistent communication and a hesitant to offer oppinions as a group. It seemed as though we were most comfortable keeping our opinions and workload to ourselves.
There was a lack of consistent, clear, and colaborative communication througout for a variety of reasons.

how resolved
It seemed as though we recognized each other's comfort level and allowed each other the trust to complete our goals. We understood when issues came up and offered further meeting times and check ins. there was a team member who was able to lead coordination and ensured to follow up with each team member

What different next time
I would offer more concrete check in expectations in meetings and in communications. I would be more direct with my questions and clearer with what I was completeing. I would ask what they saw as the final projext/ what they were planning on saying vs keeping it vauge and asking what they were wanting. I would ask for more concrete updates and plans

strenghs as team
we had a strength of completing our work and my teammates, although being most comfortable working separately, ent above nd beyond in delivering what was asked
  tips and tricks to share with a new cohort
  no
  
## Project Summary
The project in question was to use quantifiable features of a song and attempt classify a song into genre or moods. We used a 1.2+M song list from Kaggle and looked for feaures such as tempo and varience to look at. We used an unsupervies machine learnig model to group the date into 6 clusters using the features. We determined that mood is too subjective to catagorize each of the clusters into the mood, but we did give them arbitrary labels for each group on the look up thing
